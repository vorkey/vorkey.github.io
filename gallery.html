        <h1>Gallery</h1>
        <p>This is my gallery. Here are some images from my laptop.</p>
        <img src='res/screenshot1.png' alt='a screenshot from my laptop running lubuntu' title='screenshot1' width='800'/><br>
        <img src='res/screenshot2.png' alt='another screenshot from my laptop running a text editor and document viewer' title='screenshot2' width='800'/><br>
        <img src='res/screenshot3.png' alt='creating game with godot' title='screenshot3' width='800'/><br>
        <img src='res/screenshot4.png' alt='my desktop screen' title='screenshot4' width='800'/><br>
        <img src='res/screenshot.jpg' alt='playing Touhou: Luna Night' title='screenshot' width='800'/><br>

        <p>Use .jpeg format to images with a lot of colors and .png or .gif for images with small amount of colors or images with large area of same color.<br> Also choose the right size and resolution for images to show either in portrait or landscape mode.<br> Usually computer display images at 72 ppi / pixels per inch.</p>
        <p>Due to the fact that computer displays are capped at a resolution of 72 ppi, using images on the web with a higher resolution will not result in better image quality â€” only in larger file sizes, which will increase the time needed to load them and therefore slow down viewing of your web pages.</p>
